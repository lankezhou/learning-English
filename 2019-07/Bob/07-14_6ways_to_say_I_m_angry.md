#### 1.  So one of the things that you want to learn to be able to express in English is your emotions, and in today's English lesson we're going to look at the emotion of anger.

- emotion [ɪ'məʊʃ(ə)n] 情绪
- anger ['æŋgə] 愤怒

#### 2. I'm actually angry with myself right now because I wanted to use my tractor today to cut some hay but when I went to start it I found out that the battery is dead.

- found out 找出
- battery ['bætri] 电池

#### 3. So I have the charger hooked up.

- 所以我把充电器接上了
- charger ['tʃɑːdʒə] 充电器

#### 4. So the first and simplest way to express that you are feeling the emotion of anger in English is to simply say, "I am angry." 

- simplest ['sɪmplɪst]

#### 5. That is a complete sentence, and it clearly expresses that you are feeling the emotion of anger. 

-  a complete sentence 完整的句子；sentence ['sent(ə)ns] 句子

#### 6. So we add the word "with" after the word "angry" to indicate who we are angry with. 

- indicate ['ɪndɪkeɪt] 表明

#### 7. A second way to express the emotion of anger in English is to say, "I am annoyed." When you are annoyed you're just a little bit angry.

- annoyed [ə'nɒɪd] 烦恼的

#### 8. Maybe you have a couple of good friends and you find out that they went to a concert the week before and they didn't invite you. In that situation you would most likely say, "I am annoyed." 

-  a couple of 三两个，几个
- find out 找出（注：重复出现）
- concert ['kɒnsət] 音乐会
- situation [sɪtjʊ'eɪʃ(ə)n] 情况

#### 9.  A third way to express anger in English is to say, "I am ticked.", or, "I am ticked off." They mean the same thing and they can be used interchangeably.

- ticked [tikt] 生气
- interchangeably  [ɪntə'tʃeɪn(d)ʒəbli] 可互换的

#### 10. But you need to be careful because the saying, "I'm pissed.", in English can also mean that you went out and you had too many alcoholic beverages, that you drank too much, and you're a little bit drunk.

- pissed [pɪst] 醉的或恼火的
- alcoholic beverages [食品] 酒精饮料，alcoholic [ælkə'hɒlɪk] 酒精的，beverage ['bev(ə)rɪdʒ] 饮料

#### 11. And also this phrase is very informal.

- informal [ɪn'fɔːm(ə)l]  非正式的

#### 12. You would only use this phrase with family and friends when having a casual conversation. 

- casual ['kæʒjʊəl] 随便的

#### 13. A fifth and a very common way to express anger in English is to use, "mad". "I am mad", or, "I am mad at. . ."

- mad 生气的

#### 14. "I am mad at my sister because she smashed up my car."

- smashed up my car 砸了我的车；smash up 撞毁，smashed [smæʃt] smash 的过去式和过去分词

#### 15.You might hear variations of this but the most correct way to use angry and mad is to say, "I am angry with my sister…", and, "I am mad at sister…" Notice the difference there.

- variation [veərɪ'eɪʃ(ə)n] 变化

#### 16. So a sixth way to express anger in English is to say, "I am furious!" When you are furious you are really, really mad.

- furious ['fjʊərɪəs] 狂怒的
