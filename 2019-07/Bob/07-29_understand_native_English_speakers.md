#### 3. You can speed me up.

- 你可以让我加快速度

#### 4.  There's a little ant on me right now.

#### 6. That would be a great way for you to see interaction between two different English speakers, and I hope to do that soon.

#### 7.  You're getting used to me.

- 你会习惯我的

#### 8. You have become tuned in with the way that I speak.

- 你已经习惯了我说话的方式
- tuned [tjuːn] 调整

#### 9.  The more you listen to a certain native English speaker, the more you will understand that native speaker, because my tone, my speed, my cadence, my pronunciation is all becoming familiar to you.

- tone [təʊn] 语气
- cadence [ˈkeɪdns] 节奏

#### 10.  I know it sounds kind of odd for a Youtuber to tell you to go watch other people, but you should.

- odd [ɒd] 古怪的

#### 11. The fourth reason you find it easy to understand me is that I'm a very logical person.

- a very logical person 一个非常有逻辑的人；logical ['lɒdʒɪk(ə)l] 合逻辑的

#### 12. So when I design my lessons I take extra care and time to make sure that it is put together logically. 

- extra ['ekstrə] 额外的
- logically ['lɑdʒɪkli] 逻辑上

#### 13. The best way for you to address this problem is to watch things that are less logical.

#### 14. My number one recommendation is to watch English language reality TV shows. Shows where people argue, where people fight, where people hang out together.

- recommendation [,rekəmen'deɪʃ(ə)n] 推荐
- reality TV shows 真人秀；reality [rɪ'ælɪtɪ] 现实
- hang out 闲逛

#### 15. If you could find an English language reality TV show, like Survivor. One of those shows where it is unscripted, where people are just talking to each other and having great English conversations.

- survivor [sə'vaɪvə] 幸存者
- unscripted [ʌn'skrɪptɪd] 不用稿子的

#### 16. The more you can participate in something where it's not topical, where there's no topic, it will help strengthen your English as well.

- topical ['tɒpɪk(ə)l] 专题的
- participate [pɑː'tɪsɪpeɪt] 参与
- strengthen ['streŋθ(ə)n] 加强

#### 17. It's easy to understand me because in advance you're kind of aware of the topic and the best way to deal with it is to watch things like English live streams. 

- because in advance you're kind of aware of the topic 因为事先你就知道这个话题了； in advance 预先，[əd'vɑːns] 预先的，aware [ə'weə] 知道的
