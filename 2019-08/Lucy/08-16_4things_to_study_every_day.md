#### 1. Today I am going to talk to you about the four things that you need to study every single day if you want to improve your english quickly, in a short period of time.

- in a short period of time 在很短的时间内

#### 2. Now I have made quite a few videos about how you can incorporate and integrate english into your daily life.

- incorporate and integrate english into your daily life 将英语融入你的日常生活；incorporate [ɪn'kɔːpəreɪt] 整合，integrate ['ɪntɪgreɪt] 集成

#### 3. Throughout this video, I'm going to answer loads of the most popular questions that you put underneath all of my videos.

- throughout this video 在这个视频中；throughout [θruː'aʊt] 贯穿
- underneath [ʌndə'niːθ] 在……底下

#### 4. Should I learn grammar first and then perfect my pronunciation?

- perfect  [ˈpɜ:fɪkt; (for v.) pəˈfekt] 完美的，使完美

#### 5. And my honest, professional opinion is that pronunciation should be studied from the very, very beginning.

- professional opinion 专业意见
- very beginning 一开始

#### 6. But I've seen many teachers put too little emphasis on pronunciation and too much emphasis on grammar.

- emphasis ['emfəsɪs] 重点

#### 7. I taught in Spain and I saw students leave school with great grammar, sometimes better than my own, but I couldn't understand what they were saying because their pronunciation was so bad.

- taught [tɔːt] 教授（teach的过去分词）

#### 8. because grammar is a strict set of rules, but pronunciation is a lot harder, there's an art to it.

- 因为语法是一套严格的规则，但是发音要困难得多，这是一门艺术。

#### 9. Once you know how a word is pronounced, you will understand it when somebody says it to you.

- pronounced [prə'naʊnst] 发音

#### 10. Students always ask me why their listening skills are so bad, and I tell them it's probably because your pronunciation skills are lacking.

- your pronunciation skills are lacking 你的发音技巧很差；lacking ['lækɪŋ] 缺乏的

#### 11. the international phonetic alphabe

- 国际音标字母表
- phonetic [fə'netɪk] 音标
- alphabe ['ælfəbet] 字母表

#### 12. Now in complicated terms, the IPA is an alphabetic system of phonetic notion based on the Latin language.

- 在复杂的术语中，IPA是一个基于拉丁语言的音标字母系统。
- complicated ['kɒmplɪkeɪtɪd] 复杂的
- alphabetic ['ælfəbetɪk] 字母的
- notion ['nəʊʃ(ə)n] 概念
- Latin ['lætɪn] 拉丁语

#### 13. But in simple terms, it's a tool that will help you understand phonetic transcriptions.

- phonetic transcription 音标；transcriptions [træn'skrɪpʃ(ə)n] 音标

#### 14. Those little squiggly, weird words that I often put in my pronunciation videos.

- squiggly ['skwɪgli] 弯弯曲曲

#### 15. I have put a link in the description box to my absolute favourite interactive IPA chart.

- interactive [ɪntər'æktɪv] 交互式的
- chart [tʃɑːt] 图表

#### 16. You click on each element and somebody says it for you.

- element ['elɪm(ə)nt] 元素

#### 17. It's brilliant.

- 这非常出色
- brilliant [ˈbrɪlɪənt] 出色的

#### 18. If you dedicate yourself to learning one phoneme or one diphthong each day, within two months you will know the whole thing.

- dedicate ['dedɪkeɪt] 致力
- one phoneme or one diphthong 一个音素或一个双元音；phoneme ['fəʊniːm]，diphthong['dɪfθɒŋ]

#### 19. Once you understand the differences, you'll be more in tune to the general pronunciation of english.

- tune [tjuːn] 适应 

#### 20. The Lingoda Language Marathon is the perfect way to study every single day and make a massive, massive impact on your fluency.

- massive ['mæsɪv] 巨大的
- impact ['ɪmpækt] 影响
- fluency ['fluːənsɪ] 流利

#### 21. You can also have a look at Lingoda's Instagram page to see more inspiring stories.

- inspiring stories 振奋人心的故事；inspiring [ɪn'spaɪərɪŋ] 鼓舞人心的

#### 22. Well it's basically a really motivating study challenge.

- motivating study challenge 激励学习的挑战；motivate ['məʊtɪveɪt] 激励

#### 23. You study everyday, unless you take the half marathon where you study slightly less.

- marathon ['mærəθ(ə)n] 马拉松

#### . And if you complete the marathon successfully, you get a 100% refund or a 50% refund if you do the half marathon.

- refund [ˈriːfʌnd] 退款

#### . That is such a great incentive that will really stop you from procrastinating.

- incentive [ɪn'sentɪv] 激励
- stop you from procrastinating 停止拖延；procrastinate [prə(ʊ)'kræstɪneɪt] 拖延
