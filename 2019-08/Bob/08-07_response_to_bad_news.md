#### 1. So I'll look at 10 different scenarios, 10 different examples.

- scenarios [sɪ'nɑːrɪəʊ] 方案

#### 2. that you're their friend and it makes them feel that you are being sympathetic to them.

- sympathetic [sɪmpə'θetɪk] 同情的

#### 3. So when you say someone's been let go it means they've been fired. 

#### 4. Which is actually a perfect response in that situation to say, "That sucks!" because you like your friend, you think your friend's probably a good worker and you really feel like the situation sucks for them. 

- That sucks 糟糕透了；suck [sʌk] 糟透了

#### 5. So let's imagine again that you have friend and they call you and they say, "My son just got kicked out of his school for doing bad things."

- got kicked out of his school for doing bad things 因为做坏事被学校开除了；kick out 开除，kick [kɪk] 踢

#### 6. "Oh, that's so disappointing!" So we're, we're using the actual word here.

- we're using the actual word here 我们这里用的是实际的词；actual ['æktʃʊəl] 实际的

#### 7. That would be a great time when they tell you that, that would be a great time to say, "Ah, what a bummer!" or "You must have really been bummed out!"

- what a bummer 太扫兴了；bummer ['bʌmə] 失望（或不愉快）的局面（或情形）
- You must have really been bummed out 你一定很沮丧；bummed out 失望（英语俚语）

#### 8. Because it's pretty disappointing to be one point away from winning a championship.

- championship ['tʃæmpɪənʃɪp] 冠军称号

#### 9. when someone shares something is just to say, "That's stinks! ' So we smell with our nose, when something doesn't smell good we say, "That stinks!",

- That's stinks 这很臭；stink [stɪŋk] 臭气熏天的

#### 10. So let's say someone says to you, "My cousin borrowed my car and he got in an accident." A really good response would be, "That stinks!" because that does stink.

- cousin ['kʌz(ə)n] 堂兄弟
- That stinks 太糟糕了；stink [stɪŋk] 糟糕

#### 11. So a good example would be, maybe a friend says, "My brother got arrested for stealing a car."

- got arrested for stealing a car 他因偷车而被捕；arrest [ə'rest] 逮捕

#### 12. A great response then would be, "That's not good!" because you're, you're expressing some sympathy, you feel bad that that person has a relative who committed a crime, so you feel bad for that person but you could definitely in that situation just say, "That's not good!" Because it's not!

- sympathy ['sɪmpəθɪ] 同情
- a relative who committed a crime 有个亲戚犯了罪；relative ['relətɪv] 亲戚；committed a crime 犯罪；crime [kraɪm] 罪行

#### 13. But we do say that things are a pain in the butt. 

- a pain in the butt 令人讨厌的

#### 14. So maybe someone has a brother who's constantly borrowing their car and bringing it back with the gas tank empty.

- constantly ['kɒnst(ə)ntlɪ]
- gas tank 汽车之油箱；tank [tæŋk] 箱

#### 15.  "Oh I was bringing a cake to the table at my sister's birthday and I dropped it on the floor!" You could respond by saying, "Oh, that must have been a disaster!" or "Wow, that would be a real disaster!"
