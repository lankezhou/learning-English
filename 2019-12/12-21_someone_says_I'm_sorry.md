#### 1. Maybe you have planned to have lunch together at one o'clock and the clock is ticking and your friend is late.

- the clock is ticking 时间在流逝；ticking [ˈtɪkɪŋ] 发出滴答声

#### 2. When your friend shows up they might say "I'm sorry I'm late I had a few things to take care of at work and it was hard for me to get here on time."

- shows up 露面

#### 3. I'm assuming you're not upset that they're late if you response that way.

- assuming [əˈsjuːmɪŋ] 设想
- upset [ʌpˈset] 心烦的

#### 4. Maybe your mechanic phones you and says, "We're sorry your car isn't going to be done until five." 

- mechanic [məˈkænɪk] 技工

#### 5. When you lent your phone to a friend and while they were using it they dropped it on the ground and broke it.

- lent your phone to a friend
- dropped it on the ground and broke it 把它掉在地上摔碎了

#### 6. Or there's a shorter form of don't worry about it which is, "No worries!"

- a shorter form of don't worry about it 它是don't worry about it的缩写形式；a shorter form 更短的形式

#### 7. For our sixth phrase imagine you're at a busy subway station and someone bumps into you and they say, of course, "I'm sorry!"

- someone bumps into you 有人撞到你；bumps into 撞上；bump [bʌmp] 撞击

#### 8. I wasn't hurt, it was just a soft bump, everything is okay.
