#### 1. It is a reality TV show, that means it takes place kind of in real life.

- a reality TV show 真人秀；reality [riˈæləti] 真实

#### 2. And the reason I like this show is because the people who are in The Amazing Race, the competitors in The Amazing Race, have to do a series of challenges, and those challenges are often in real world situations.

- competitors [kəmˈpetɪtə(r)] 竞争者 
- a series of challenges 一系列的挑战

#### 3. So you get a lot of really good, authentic English conversation when you watch The Amazing Race.

- authentic English conversation 正宗的英语会话；authentic [ɔːˈθentɪk]

#### 4. Because it's competition, you also learn some words and phrases for cheering people on when they're doing certain things.

- competition [ˌkɒmpəˈtɪʃn] 竞争 

#### 5. And you get to have a small glimpse of what it's like in other countries.

- a small glimpse of 一瞥；glimpse [ɡlɪmps] 一瞥

#### 6. People are on an island and they can't get off, and every week someone gets kicked off the island.

- get off 跑出
- someone gets kicked off the island 有人被赶出了小岛；kick off 踢开

#### 7. People do things in the show that annoy other people, and so you end up with these great authentic English conversations, or arguments where people are kind of verbally fighting with each other, so it's a great show for that reason.

- annoy other people 骚扰别人；annoy [əˈnɔɪ] 骚扰 
- you end up with these great authentic English conversations 你会以这些地道的英语对话结束；end up with 以…而结束
- verbally fighting with each other 互相斗嘴；verbally [ˈvɜːbəli] 口头地

#### 8. The third show that I think you should watch is an older show, and it's called Friends. It's a show about three ladies that live together, and three that live across the hall.

- an older show 
- live across the hall 住在对面

#### 9. But what I like the best about that show is the characters are very relatable.

- the characters are very relatable 人物性格很相似；characters [ˈkærəktə(r)z] 人物角色，relatable 

#### 10. So that's a little clue for you.

- clue [kluː] 线索

#### 11. So on the show Jeopardy there are three contestants, and they have to try and guess the answers to the question that the host asks.

- three contestants 三个选手；contestants [kənˈtestənt] 竞争者
- host [həʊst] 主持人

#### 12. Because it will help you build your vocabulary, and because it is a competition, because it is a game show, there are categories.

- build your vocabulary 打造你的词库
- competition [ˌkɒmpəˈtɪʃn] 竞争 
- there are categories 它们是有类别的；categories ['kætɪg(ə)rɪz]

#### 13. Maybe you watch rugby, and maybe you watch cricket.
