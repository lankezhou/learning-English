#### 3. We will also buy a gift for someone when they have an anniversary.

#### 4. We give gifts on Valentine's Day, which is a very, very nice romantic holiday in February.

#### 5. And I think one other time when we would give gift is what's called a housewarming gift.

#### 7. But besides buying a gift or making a gift, you can also do something called regifting.

#### 8. When you regift it means you take a gift that someone else gave you for a past birthday or from a past Christmas, and if it's something that you didn't use you just wrap it up and you give it to a new person.

- regift 
- wrap it up 包起来；wrap [ræp] 包

#### 9. If you want an easier method, what I like to do is to put the gift in a gift bag and you just put some tissue on top that's different color.

- you just put some tissue on top 你只要在上面放点纸巾；tissue [ˈˈtɪsjuː] 纸巾


#### 10. And here's a little clip of me buying a gift for my daughter at a store.

#### 12. So, we have quite a selection here of earrings.
