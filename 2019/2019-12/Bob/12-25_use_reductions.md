#### 1. reductions 缩写

#### 2. We take sentences like, "Let me show you how to do that." and we compress it into, "Lemme show you how to do that."

- compress it into 压缩成；compress [kəmˈpres] 压缩

#### 3. The next reduction I want to teach you takes the words, "going to", and it squishes them into the word, "gonna".

- squishes them into 压成；squishes [skwɪʃ] 挤进

#### 4. So I could say that, "Tonight I am going to eat ice cream.", and the reduced form would be, "Tonight I'm gonna eat ice cream."

- reduced form 简化型

#### 5. So I hope you're enjoying the fact that I'm putting sentences on the screen and then pretending to squish them, because I could have just stood in front of a whiteboard to teach this lesson.

- pretending to squish them 假装要把它们压扁；pretending 假装
- whiteboard [ˈwaɪtbɔːrd] 白板 

#### 6. So the phrase "could have", we take the words, "could have", is another reduction when we say this in spoken English, we usually say, "coulda".

- spoken English 英语口语

#### 7. Sometimes they just use the contraction and say, "I don't know." But rarely do they actually say, "I do not know."

- contraction [kənˈtrækʃn] 收缩
- rarely [ˈreəli] 很少地

#### 8. They don't usually say the full and proper sentence.

- full and proper sentence 完整适当句

#### 9. Don't you have a pen in your locker?

- locker [ˈlɒkə(r)] 存放柜

#### 10. Doncha have a pencil in your pencil case?

- pencil case 文具盒
