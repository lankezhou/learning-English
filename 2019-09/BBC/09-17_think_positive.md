#### 1. If your head's in a spin because you've had a bad night's sleep, or you've hungover, or maybe you've just got too much to do, the chances are you're not in the best of moods.

- head's in a spin 晕头转向；spin [spɪn] 晕眩
- hungover ['hʌŋ'əʊvə] 宿醉

#### . If everything seems like an effort and you have a negative attitude, the last thing you want to be told it to 'be positive!'

- negative attitude 消极态度；negative ['negətɪv] 消极的，attitude ['ætɪtjuːd] 态度

#### . But having this mindset could have more benefits than you think.

- mindset ['maɪn(d)set] 心态

#### . Of course, developing a positive attitude is easier said than done -- it doesn't come naturally to everyone. 

- is easier said than done 说起来容易，做起来难
- come naturally 天生的
